# 🕯️ The Forgotten Trial  
*A Tactical RPG Mystery Experience*

Developed in **Unreal Engine 5.5.4**, *The Forgotten Trial* is a cinematic single-player tactical RPG that plunges players into a mind-bending journey of identity, betrayal, and survival. With AI-driven storytelling, grid-based combat, and a haunted fortress to explore, the line between reality and memory begins to blur.

## 🎮 Game Overview

**The Forgotten Trial** delivers a deeply atmospheric, story-rich experience inspired by tactical RPG classics. Players control a small, amnesiac party navigating a cursed stronghold where cryptic whispers guide their every move.

As memories unravel and relationships evolve, choices made in battle and conversation shape the fate of the forgotten.
